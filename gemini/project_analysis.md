Based on the files, here's an in-depth understanding of the project:

**Project Goal:**

The project, `jattac.libs.web.responsive-table`, is a reusable **React component library** that provides a highly customizable and responsive table. The key feature is its ability to transform from a traditional tabular layout on larger screens to a more readable card-based layout on mobile devices.

**Core Functionality & Features:**

*   **Responsiveness:** This is the primary selling point. It automatically adapts the table's presentation based on the screen width (`mobileBreakpoint` prop), ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile.
*   **Data-Driven:** The table is populated with data passed through the `data` prop. The structure of the table (columns) is defined by the `columnDefinitions` prop.
*   **Customizable Rendering:** The `cellRenderer` function in the column definitions allows developers to render any React component within a cell, enabling rich content like buttons, links, formatted text, and more.
*   **Dynamic Columns:** Column definitions can be functions, allowing for the dynamic creation of columns based on application state or data properties (e.g., showing an "Admin Actions" column only for admin users).
*   **Interactivity:**
    *   **Row Clicks:** The `onRowClick` prop allows for handling clicks on entire table rows.
    *   **Header Clicks:** The `interactivity` property on a column definition enables click handlers for table headers, useful for sorting or filtering actions.
*   **Loading and Empty States:**
    *   It provides a `isLoading` prop to display a skeleton loader while data is being fetched, improving the user experience.
    *   A customizable `noDataComponent` can be shown when there's no data to display.
*   **Animations:** It supports optional staggered entrance animations for rows (`animateOnLoad` prop) to make the table feel more dynamic.
*   **Table Footer:** The `footerRows` prop allows for adding a footer to the table, which is also responsive. This is useful for displaying summary information like totals.
*   **Styling:** It uses CSS Modules (`ResponsiveTable.module.css`) for scoped styling, preventing style conflicts with other parts of an application. It also uses CSS variables for easy theming.

**Project Structure & Technology Stack:**

*   **Language:** TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`) and JavaScript for the build configuration.
*   **Framework:** React.
*   **Build Tool:** Rollup is used to bundle the library for distribution. The `rollup.config.js` file defines the build process, including plugins for handling TypeScript, PostCSS (for CSS Modules), and resolving dependencies.
*   **Package Manager:** npm.
*   **Linting & Formatting:** ESLint and Prettier are used to maintain code quality and consistency.
*   **Testing:** While no test files are present, the `package.json` includes dependencies for `@testing-library/react`, indicating that testing is intended for this project.
*   **Distribution:** The `dist` directory (ignored by Git) is the output for the bundled library, which is then published to npm. The `package.json` defines the entry points (`main`, `module`, `types`).

**Development & Maintenance:**

*   The project includes shell scripts (`set-origin-urls.sh`, `update-dependancies.sh`) to help with development tasks like updating remote URLs and managing dependencies.
*   The `README.md` is comprehensive, providing clear installation instructions, getting-started examples, and a detailed API reference. This is crucial for a library intended for other developers to use.

**Overall Impression:**

This is a well-structured and well-documented React component library. It solves a common problem (responsive tables) with a modern and flexible approach. The focus on customization, performance (debounced resize handling), and developer experience (clear documentation, helpful scripts) makes it a high-quality project. The use of TypeScript, CSS Modules, and a proper build process are all signs of a professional and maintainable codebase.
