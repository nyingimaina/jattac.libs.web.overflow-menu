# Inferred Project Goals and Developer Preferences (Session 7)

This document captures additional key goals and preferences inferred from our recent development interactions, building upon the previous sets of principles.

## New Inferences

1.  **Advanced TypeScript for Enhanced Developer Experience and Compile-Time Safety:**
    *   **Observation:** The project demonstrates a strong commitment to leveraging advanced TypeScript features to improve developer experience (DX) and ensure robust compile-time safety, particularly for complex component configurations.
    *   **Example Scenario:** To address the need for compile-time validation and IDE autocompletion for `dataKey` (a property used to link column definitions to data object properties), a sophisticated type-checking mechanism was implemented. Instead of simply making `dataKey` an optional string, the `IResponsiveTableColumnDefinition` interface was refactored into a **discriminated union**. This pattern allows TypeScript to enforce conditional requirements: if a column is configured for sorting or filtering (by providing `getSortableValue`, `sortComparer`, or `getFilterableValue`), then `dataKey` becomes a **required** property and is strictly typed as `keyof TData` (meaning it must be a valid property name of the data object). Conversely, if no sorting or filtering properties are present, `dataKey` remains optional. This approach provides immediate feedback to developers in their IDEs, preventing common runtime errors related to missing or mistyped data keys, and significantly enhances the overall type safety and usability of the component's API.
