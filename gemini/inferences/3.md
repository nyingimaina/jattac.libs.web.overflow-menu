# Inferred Project Goals and Developer Preferences (Session 3: Deep Code Understanding & Debugging)

This document captures key goals and preferences inferred from interactions that required a deep dive into the codebase's intricacies and debugging across different layers of the application.

## Key Inferences

1.  **Expectation of Deep Code-Level Understanding for Effective Problem Solving:**
    *   **Observation:** There is a clear expectation that the development agent (me) possesses a granular and precise understanding of the project's internal implementation details. This extends beyond high-level architecture to specific framework patterns, styling methodologies, and type system nuances.
    *   **Example Scenario:** When a UI issue arose where sortable column headers were not visually interactive despite the underlying sorting logic being correct, the diagnosis required understanding how CSS Modules generate unique class names, how React components apply props, and how TypeScript interfaces enforce contracts. The ability to quickly pinpoint the exact line of code or configuration (e.g., a missing `dataKey` in a column definition, or an incorrect CSS Module class application) that caused the discrepancy was critical. This demonstrates that effective problem-solving in this project relies on a comprehensive grasp of the entire technology stack, from data flow to rendering specifics.

2.  **Multi-Layer Debugging Capability is Essential:**
    *   **Observation:** The project demands the ability to debug issues that span across different technological layers of the application. Problems are not confined to a single domain (e.g., just React logic or just CSS) but often involve interactions between them.
    *   **Example Scenario:** A bug where the sortable column headers were not displaying the correct mouse pointer on hover, despite the `cursor: pointer` being defined in CSS, required debugging across the CSS styling, the React component's rendering of `<th>` elements, and the plugin's injection of properties. The solution involved understanding CSS specificity and how nested elements inherit or override cursor properties. This highlights the need for a holistic debugging approach that can trace issues from the visual output back through the component tree, plugin interactions, and styling rules.

These inferences reinforce the existing principles of "Developer Experience (DX) is a Top Priority" and "Robust & Extensible Architecture," as precise code-level understanding and multi-layer debugging capabilities are fundamental to maintaining a high-quality and efficient development process.
