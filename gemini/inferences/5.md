# Inferred Project Goals and Developer Preferences (Session 5)

This document captures additional key goals and preferences inferred from our recent development interactions, building upon the previous sets of principles.

## New Inferences

1.  **Emphasis on Subtle Micro-Interactions for Enhanced UX:**
    *   **Observation:** The project places significant value on refining even the smallest user interface details, such as the behavior of the mouse pointer and the visual feedback on interactive elements. This goes beyond basic functionality to create a "delightful" and "polished" user experience.
    *   **Example Scenario:** When a user hovers over a sortable column header, the expectation is not just for the cursor to change, but for a subtle visual cue (e.g., a slight zoom-in/out animation on the header itself) to indicate interactivity without causing layout shifts. This attention to detail aims to make the interface feel more responsive and intuitive, guiding the user's interaction seamlessly.

2.  **Preference for Performant, CSS-Driven UI Effects:**
    *   **Observation:** There is a clear preference for implementing UI effects and visual cues using pure CSS whenever feasible, rather than relying on JavaScript. This approach is chosen for its benefits in performance, maintainability, and theming flexibility.
    *   **Example Scenario:** Instead of using JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements for sort icons or hover animations, the project leverages CSS pseudo-elements, `background-image` with embedded SVGs, `opacity` transitions, and `transform` properties. This ensures that visual elements like sort icons (e.g., ghosted funnel for unsorted, colored arrows for sorted states) are rendered efficiently, scale perfectly, and can be easily customized through CSS variables or overrides by the consuming application.

3.  **Iterative Refinement as a Core Development Practice:**
    *   **Observation:** The development process involves continuous iteration and refinement, particularly for UI/UX aspects. Feedback on subtle visual or interactive discrepancies leads to further adjustments until the desired level of polish is achieved.
    *   **Example Scenario:** Initial implementations of features (e.g., sortable column headers) are followed by detailed reviews of their visual behavior (e.g., correct arrow display, mouse pointer changes, text overlap). Any identified imperfections, no matter how minor, trigger further rounds of CSS or component adjustments. This iterative loop ensures that the final product meets a high standard of visual and interactive quality.
