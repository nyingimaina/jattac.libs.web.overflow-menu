### Full Accessibility

The component is built on top of Radix UI primitives, ensuring that it is fully accessible to all users. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA Menu Button pattern, providing:
- Full keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, Space, Escape, Tab).
- Focus management to ensure proper tab order.
- ARIA attributes that automatically communicate the state of the menu to assistive technologies.

For implementation details, refer to the [Simple Action Menu recipe](./examples.md#simple-action-menu).

### Multi-Level Submenus

Organize complex sets of actions with ease using recursive submenus. The library handles the logic for positioning, timing, and keyboard navigation for nested menus, ensuring a smooth experience regardless of depth.

For implementation details, refer to the [Multi-Level Child Menus recipe](./examples.md#multi-level-child-menus).

### Advanced Animations

Powered by Framer Motion, every interaction feels deliberate and responsive. The trigger features spring-based hover effects, and the menu items use staggered entry animations to guide the user's eye.

### Modern Frosted-Glass Aesthetic

Out of the box, the component features a "glassmorphism" design, including backdrop blur and a subtle translucent background. This allows it to blend seamlessly into modern, high-quality user interfaces without extensive customization.

### Flexible Trigger Icons

The default "three dots" icon is animated and interactive. However, the component supports any React node as a custom trigger, making it easy to adapt to your application's specific iconography.

For implementation details, refer to the [Custom Trigger Icon recipe](./examples.md#custom-trigger-icon).
